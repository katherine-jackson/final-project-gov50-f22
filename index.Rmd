## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to payday loans. Indeed, I would like to look at the number of payday loan businessese in a neighbourhood and a neighbourhood's wealth. I would ideally like to be able to create a model, where the number of payday loan businesses in a certain area is a predictor for the median income for that neighbourhood.

This topic is motivated by my walks to work this summer.I would pass by the same 2-3 payday loan businesses everyday and it got me thinking about how low of a median income does a neighbourhood need to have before its residents require payday loans to get by. Expanding this idea further, I could also look into foreign exchange counters, and how they are a predictor of median income, or the immigrant population of an area.
